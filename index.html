<!-- helene, here you can write something like---the business/restaurant is being run by a married coupe
- husband and wife- that they not only decided to live a long life together 
but also share their dream of having a restaurant  -->

        <p>Comfy Food offers a selection of “comfort” foods to satisfy
        your appetite. Everything is prepared daily with simple ingredients
        and sourced locally when possible. We offer a few vegan and many 
        vegetarian options and use organics when markets permit. 
        Chef Claire’s flavours stem from being raised by her grandmother 
        along the appalachian trail in Caratunk Maine at the base of Moxie 
        mountain.</p><br>

        <p> We believe cookery, like eating, is both enjoyable and nourishing. It’s also a simple and practical way of promoting good food. Cooking helps us to feel confident about who we are and gives us the chance to express ourselves creatively while doing something deeply practical with edible results.

Cooking and eating together is a simple way of connecting with other people. It helps individuals, families and communities to be healthier, more connected and in tune with the natural rhythms of life.

We believe in Good Food for All:</p><br>
<p>COOKING AND ENJOYING GOOD, FRESH FOOD
USING LOCAL AND ETHICALLY SOURCED INGREDIENTS
UNDERSTANDING WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM
SHARING AND EATING FOOD WITH OTHER PEOPLE
PASSING ON SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
WORKING WITH EACH OTHER TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM FOR US ALL.</p><br>
